## Project Overview
This project is a **menu-driven console application** implemented in Java that performs various operations on an integer array. It is designed as part of a collaboration assignment where each team member contributes to the development.

## Features
- Generate an integer array of random values within the range `[0, 100]`.
- Display a menu and process user selections until they choose to exit.
- Find and display the **minimum and maximum** values in the array.
- Compute and display the **average** of the array, along with the difference of each element from the average.
- Compute and display the **sum of elements** at **odd- and even-numbered indexes**.

## Collaboration & Workflow
1. One team member creates the GitHub repository and adds others as **collaborators**.
2. Each team member is responsible for **at least one feature**.
3. Team members work on **separate computers**, making commits and pushing changes regularly.
4. Merge conflicts are resolved collaboratively when necessary.
5. The final version is demonstrated to the **TA/Tutor** in the lab.

## Contribution Guidelines
- Each member should make **at least one commit**.
- Follow proper **commit message conventions** (e.g., `Added min/max functionality`).
- Ensure the code is **properly formatted** and **commented**.
- Keep the repository **organized** and avoid unnecessary files.

## Demonstration
- The working program and commit history will be presented to the **TA/Tutor** in the lab session.
- Ensure that all required functionalities are implemented and tested.
